Diego's Cops and Robbers - https://gtaconnected.com


Welcome to the d-cnr Server repository! This project aims to provide a versatile Cops and Robbers server for various Grand Theft Auto games, including GTA III, GTA Vice City, GTA San Andreas, and GTA IV on GTA Connected.

## Introduction

GTA Connected doesn't have many servers. I don't personally have the time or motivation to fully commit to working on a server. Hence I decided to make this open source. Hopefully, this repo can be a pathway for more creations on GTAC and more players playing on a server. Hopefully, other programmers can get ideas and contribute to this server. Once the server is at a point where it's playable, I will host the script, hire a staff team, and get the server running.

## Development
- Community-driven development: Join a vibrant community of developers and players contributing to the server's growth and improvement.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to help improve the GTA Connected Server. Whether you're a developer, designer, or avid player, there are many ways to get involved:

- Submit bug reports or feature requests through GitHub Issues.
- Contribute code enhancements or new features via Pull Requests.
- Share your ideas and suggestions on our community forums or Discord server.

To learn more about contributing to the project, please read our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Am allowed to run the script for myself?
Short answer; technically. I don't want to split up players with multiple CnR servers on multiple servers with the same script. So I have the right within the license to authorize a takedown if the license isn't followed. I mostly just want contributions to the script and developers getting ideas to make their own gamemode/resource.
If an issue begins to occur, I will private the repository and only invite contributors to it.
